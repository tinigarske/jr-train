A chunk of R code:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

## rmarkdown::render("exercises/chapter1/markdown1.Rmd")


## data(gapminder, package = "gapminder")
## plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, dat = gapminder)

library(d3heatmap)
d3heatmap(mtcars)

mtcars = mtcars[sample(nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE), ]
test = t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 15)

```

The average mpg of cars that were surveyed was `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`
My hypothesis test gave a p-value of `r test$p.value`
