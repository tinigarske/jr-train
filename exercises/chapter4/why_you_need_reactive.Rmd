### Problem

Each plot uses the slider value to generate random numbers. However, 

  * we want both plots to display the same data
  * we only want to call `rnorm` once. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
sliderInput(inputId = "num1", label = "Sample size",
            value = 25, min = 1, max = 100)

## Both plots get different data!!
## rnorm has been executed twice!
renderPlot({
  x = rnorm(input$num1)
  plot(x)
})

renderPlot({
  x = rnorm(input$num1)
  plot(x)
})
```

### Solution

Create a `reactive` object that each plot can access.

```{r, echo=1}
x = reactive(rnorm(input$num1))
renderPlot({plot(x())})
renderPlot({plot(x())})
```
