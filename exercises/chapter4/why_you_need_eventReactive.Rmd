### Problem

Suppose we were accessing data from a database, or from a regression model.
This means that generating data is time consuming, so we only want to 
generate the scatter plot when we click the button `Plot data`, not when we use the sliders.

```{r echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("n", "Sample size", 10, 100, 10)
sliderInput("mean", "Mean", -10, 10, 0)
actionButton("go", "Plot data")

## We only want to plot on "go"
renderPlot(plot(rnorm(input$n, input$mean)))
```

### Solution

Use an `actionButton` in conjunction with an `eventReactive` function. This generates
a function reactive object that will only be evaluated when the `actionButton` is pressed.

```{r}
## input$go is the action button. input$n, input$mean are the sliders
data = eventReactive(input$go, rnorm(input$n, input$mean))
renderPlot(plot(data()))
```
